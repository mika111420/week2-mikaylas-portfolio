# week2-mikaylas-portfolio
Week 2 of UoM Coding Bootcamp: using advanced CSS to create my professional portfolio! 

  This weeks challenge is to, with no starter code, create an original personal portfolio to showcase the knowledge and tools learnt this week with advanced Cascading Style Sheets! This is done to meet an acceptance criteria where there is a deployed webpage with an "About Me" section with the developers name and profile image, and links to sections of work and contact information in the header. The links to the About Me, Work, and Contact information must have the UI able to scroll to the corresponding parts of the page. Within the work section, each image has its own link that then takes the user to the deployed application. At the bottom of the page, there is a Contact section with links to various points of contact, such as email and GitHub.
